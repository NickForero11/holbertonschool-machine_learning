# 0x04. Convolutions and Pooling

---

## Learning Objectives

I learned from this project:

* What is a convolution?
* What is max pooling? average pooling?
* What is a kernel/filter?
* What is padding?
* What is “same” padding? “valid” padding?
* What is a stride?
* What are channels?
* How to perform a convolution over an image
* How to perform max/average pooling over an image

### [0. Valid Convolution](./0-convolve_grayscale_valid.py)

* Function that performs a valid convolution on grayscale images.

### [1. Same Convolution](./1-convolve_grayscale_same.py)

* Function that performs a same convolution on grayscale images.

### [2. Convolution with Padding](./2-convolve_grayscale_padding.py)

* Function that performs a convolution on grayscale images with custom padding.

### [3. Strided Convolution](./3-convolve_grayscale.py)

* Function that performs a convolution on grayscale images.

### [4. Convolution with Channels](./4-convolve_channels.py)

* Function that performs a convolution on images with channels.

### [5. Multiple Kernels](./5-convolve.py)

* Function that performs a convolution on images using multiple kernels.

### [6. Pooling](./6-pool.py)

* Function that performs pooling on images.
